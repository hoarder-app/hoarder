# Potential Improvements for Karakeep

This document lists potential areas of improvement identified during a codebase review. Improvements are categorized by perceived impact/effort (High, Medium, Low).

## High Impact/Effort

1.  **Comprehensive Test Automation Strategy:**
    *   **Description:** Implement a more robust testing strategy including unit tests for critical backend logic (tRPC routers, shared utilities) and frontend components (web, mobile). Expand end-to-end tests to cover more user scenarios and edge cases.
    *   **Benefit:** Improved code quality, easier refactoring, reduced regressions, and increased confidence in releases.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `packages/e2e_tests/`, `packages/trpc/routers/`, `apps/web/`, `apps/mobile/`, `packages/shared/`

2.  **Enhanced Worker Observability & Management:**
    *   **Description:** Implement better monitoring, logging, and alerting for background workers. Consider adding a dashboard for worker status, queue lengths, and error rates. Improve retry logic and dead-letter handling.
    *   **Benefit:** Proactive issue detection, easier troubleshooting of background tasks, and increased reliability of asynchronous operations.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/workers/`

## Medium Impact/Effort

3.  **Frontend Component Modularization & Shared UI Library:**
    *   **Description:** Identify common UI patterns and components across web and mobile applications. Extract these into a dedicated shared UI library within the `packages/` directory to promote consistency and reusability.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduced code duplication, consistent user experience across platforms, and more maintainable frontend code.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/web/components/`, `apps/mobile/components/`, `packages/shared-react/` (or a new `packages/ui/`)

4.  **Advanced AI Feature Configuration & Extensibility:**
    *   **Description:** Provide users with more granular control over AI features (tagging, summarization), such as model selection (including more local options), prompt customization, or confidence thresholds. Explore caching AI-generated content.
    *   **Benefit:** More flexible and powerful AI capabilities tailored to user needs, potential for cost/latency reduction.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/workers/workers/inference/`, `packages/shared/prompts.ts`, `apps/web/app/settings/`

5.  **Accessibility (a11y) Enhancements:**
    *   **Description:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit of the web and mobile applications. Implement necessary changes to meet WCAG standards, ensuring usability for people with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast).
    *   **Benefit:** Broader user reach and improved user experience for all.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/web/`, `apps/mobile/`

6.  **Streamlined Multi-Platform Configuration Management:**
    *   **Description:** Develop a more unified or clearly documented approach to managing configurations across different applications (web, mobile, CLI, workers) and deployment environments (Docker, Kubernetes, local).
    *   **Benefit:** Simplified setup and maintenance, reduced likelihood of configuration errors.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Documentation, `.env.sample` files, `apps/*/`

## Low Impact/Effort

7.  **Optimized Static Asset Delivery:**
    *   **Description:** Review and optimize all static assets (images, fonts) for size and format. Implement best practices for loading assets, such as lazy loading for offscreen images.
    *   **Benefit:** Faster application load times and improved perceived performance.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/web/public/`, `apps/landing/public/`, `apps/mobile/assets/`

8.  **Refined Full-Page Archival Options:**
    *   **Description:** Offer users more control over the full-page archival process, such as options for archival depth, format choice (e.g., PDF, WARC), re-archiving, and clearer feedback on archival status or failures.
    *   **Benefit:** Enhanced user control and transparency for the archival feature.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/workers/`, `apps/web/`

9.  **Improved In-Code Documentation & Type Safety:**
    *   **Description:** Encourage more consistent use of JSDoc/TSDoc comments for functions, classes, and types, particularly in shared packages. Consider adopting stricter TypeScript compiler options for earlier error detection.
    *   **Benefit:** Better code readability, easier maintenance, and improved developer experience.
    *   **Affected Areas:** All TypeScript packages and applications.

10. **Database Query Optimization Review:**
    *   **Description:** Periodically review and optimize database queries, especially those related to search, filtering, and dashboard views, to ensure performance as data volume grows. Verify appropriate indexing strategies.
    *   **Benefit:** Sustained application responsiveness and scalability.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `packages/db/`, `packages/trpc/` (query-heavy routers)
