# Potential Issues in Karakeep

This document lists potential issues identified during a codebase review. Issues are categorized by perceived severity (High, Medium, Low). This is based on a conceptual understanding and not live testing.

## High Severity

*(None identified that are definitively high without deeper runtime analysis, but some Medium issues could escalate)*

## Medium Severity

1.  **Incomplete Testing Coverage:**
    *   **Description:** While end-to-end tests exist, unit and integration test coverage for backend logic (especially tRPC routers like feeds, prompts, users) and frontend components (web, mobile) appears limited. This could lead to undetected bugs and regressions.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `packages/trpc/routers/`, `apps/web/components/`, `apps/mobile/components/`, `packages/shared/`

2.  **Potential Worker Resilience Gaps:**
    *   **Description:** Background workers (`apps/workers/`) for critical tasks (crawling, AI processing, feeds) may lack comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, or dead-letter queueing, potentially leading to silent failures or data loss.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/workers/`

3.  **Security of AI Prompt Construction:**
    *   **Description:** If user-controlled data is directly used in prompts for AI features (OpenAI, Ollama), there's a risk of prompt injection attacks, leading to unintended AI behavior or data leakage.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `packages/shared/prompts.ts`, `apps/workers/workers/inference/`

4.  **Error Handling Consistency Across Apps:**
    *   **Description:** Ensuring uniform error handling, logging, and user feedback across the diverse set of applications (web, mobile, CLI, browser extension, workers) can be challenging. Inconsistencies might hinder debugging and user experience.
    *   **Affected Areas:** All `apps/`

## Low Severity

5.  **Dependency Management Complexity:**
    *   **Description:** Managing dependencies across a large monorepo with multiple `package.json` files can become complex, potentially leading to outdated packages or version conflicts if not diligently maintained.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Root `package.json`, `apps/*/package.json`, `packages/*/package.json`

6.  **API Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:**
    *   **Description:** Public or even authenticated API endpoints might lack sufficient rate limiting or advanced abuse prevention mechanisms beyond basic authentication, making them susceptible to DoS or resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `packages/api/`, `packages/open-api/`

7.  **Configuration Management for Diverse Deployments:**
    *   **Description:** While `.env.sample` files exist, managing and documenting configurations for various deployment scenarios (Docker, Kubernetes, local dev) and across different services could be streamlined.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `.env.sample`, `docker/.env.sample`, `kubernetes/.env_sample`, documentation.

8.  **Potential Minor Code Duplication:**
    *   **Description:** Some utility functions or simple UI components might be duplicated across different applications (e.g., web vs. mobile) instead of being centralized in shared packages.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `apps/web/lib/`, `apps/mobile/lib/`, `apps/web/components/`, `apps/mobile/components/`

9.  **Documentation Synchronization:**
    *   **Description:** With ongoing active development, keeping all parts of the extensive documentation (especially API docs and versioned guides) perfectly synchronized with code changes can be challenging.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `docs/`

10. **Database Migration Robustness for Self-Hosters:**
    *   **Description:** Ensuring that database migrations (`packages/db/drizzle/`) are always smooth, backward-compatible, and well-tested is critical for self-hosted users who manage their own database instances. Complex or poorly tested migrations could cause issues.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `packages/db/`
