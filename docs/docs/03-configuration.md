# Configuration

The app is mainly configured by environment variables. All the used environment variables are listed in [packages/shared/config.ts](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep/blob/main/packages/shared/config.ts). The most important ones are:

| Name                            | Required                              | Default         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Asset Storage

Karakeep supports two storage backends for assets: local filesystem (default) and S3-compatible object storage. S3 storage is automatically detected when an S3 endpoint is passed.

| Name                             | Required          | Default | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ASSET_STORE_S3_ENDPOINT          | No                | Not set | The S3 endpoint URL. Required for S3-compatible services like MinIO. **Setting this enables S3 storage**. |
| ASSET_STORE_S3_REGION            | No                | Not set | The S3 region to use.                                                                                     |
| ASSET_STORE_S3_BUCKET            | Yes when using S3 | Not set | The S3 bucket name where assets will be stored.                                                           |
| ASSET_STORE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | Yes when using S3 | Not set | The S3 access key ID for authentication.                                                                  |
| ASSET_STORE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Yes when using S3 | Not set | The S3 secret access key for authentication.                                                              |
| ASSET_STORE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE  | No                | false   | Whether to force path-style URLs for S3 requests. Set to true for MinIO and other S3-compatible services. |

:::info
When using S3 storage, make sure the bucket exists and the provided credentials have the necessary permissions to read, write, and delete objects in the bucket.
:::

:::warning
Switching between storage backends after data has been stored will require manual migration of existing assets. Plan your storage backend choice carefully before deploying.

## Authentication / Signup

By default, Karakeep uses the database to store users, but it is possible to also use OAuth.
The flags need to be provided to the `web` container.

:::info
Only OIDC compliant OAuth providers are supported! For information on how to set it up, consult the documentation of your provider.
:::

:::info
When setting up OAuth, the allowed redirect URLs configured at the provider should be set to `<KARAKEEP_ADDRESS>/api/auth/callback/custom` where `<KARAKEEP_ADDRESS>` is the address you configured in `NEXTAUTH_URL` (for example: `https://try.karakeep.app/api/auth/callback/custom`).

## Inference Configs (For automatic tagging)

Either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` need to be set for automatic tagging to be enabled. Otherwise, automatic tagging will be skipped.

:::warning

- The quality of the tags you'll get will depend on the quality of the model you choose.
- You might want to tune the `INFERENCE_CONTEXT_LENGTH` as the default is quite small. The larger the value, the better the quality of the tags, but the more expensive the inference will be (money-wise on OpenAI and resource-wise on ollama).

More on that in [here](/openai).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| OPENAI_BASE_URL                      | No       | Not set                | If you just want to use OpenAI you don't need to pass this variable. If, however, you want to use some other openai compatible API (e.g. azure openai service), set this to the url of the API.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| INFERENCE_IMAGE_MODEL                | No       | gpt-4o-mini            | The model to use for image inference. You'll need to change this to some other model if you're using ollama and that model needs to support vision APIs (e.g. llava).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| INFERENCE_CONTEXT_LENGTH             | No       | 2048                   | The max number of tokens that we'll pass to the inference model. If your content is larger than this size, it'll be truncated to fit. The larger this value, the more of the content will be used in tag inference, but the more expensive the inference will be (money-wise on openAI and resource-wise on ollama). Check the model you're using for its max supported content size. |
| INFERENCE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS          | No       | 2048                   | The maximum number of tokens that the inference model is allowed to generate in its response. This controls the length of AI-generated content like tags and summaries. Increase this if you need longer responses, but be aware that higher values will increase costs (for OpenAI) and processing time.                                                                             |

If you're running ollama without powerful GPUs, you might want to increase the timeout a bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| INFERENCE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SEC          | No       | 300                    | \[Ollama Only\] The timeout of the fetch request to the ollama server. If your inference requests take longer than the default 5mins, you might want to increase this timeout.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Setting this to true translates to INFERENCE_OUTPUT_SCHEMA=structured, and to false translates to INFERENCE_OUTPUT_SCHEMA=plain.                                                                                                                                   |
| INFERENCE_OUTPUT_SCHEMA              | No       | structured             | Possible values are "structured", "json", "plain". Structured is the preferred option, but if your model doesn't support it, you can use "json" if your model supports JSON mode, otherwise "plain" which should be supported by all the models but the model might not output the data in the correct format.                                                                        |

:::info

- You can append additional instructions to the prompt used for automatic tagging, in the `AI Settings` (in the `User Settings` screen)
- You can use the placeholders `$tags`, `$aiTags`, `$userTags` in the prompt. These placeholders will be replaced with all tags, ai generated tags or human created tags when automatic tagging is performed (e.g. `[karakeep, computer, ai]`)

| CRAWLER_NUM_WORKERS                | No       | 1       | Number of allowed concurrent crawling jobs. By default, we're only doing one crawling request at a time to avoid consuming a lot of resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| BROWSER_WEB_URL                    | No       | Not set | The browser's http debugging address. The worker will talk to this endpoint to resolve the debugging console's websocket address. If you already have the websocket address, use `BROWSER_WEBSOCKET_URL` instead. If neither `BROWSER_WEB_URL` nor `BROWSER_WEBSOCKET_URL` are set, the worker will use plain http requests skipping screenshotting and javascript execution. |
| BROWSER_WEBSOCKET_URL              | No       | Not set | The websocket address of browser's debugging console. If you want to use [browserless](https://browserless.io), use their websocket address here. If neither `BROWSER_WEB_URL` nor `BROWSER_WEBSOCKET_URL` are set, the worker will use plain http requests skipping screenshotting and javascript execution.                                                                 |
| BROWSER_CONNECT_ONDEMAND           | No       | false   | If set to false, the crawler will proactively connect to the browser instance and always maintain an active connection. If set to true, the browser will be launched on demand only whenever a crawling is requested. Set to true if you're using a service that provides you with browser instances on demand.                                                               |
| CRAWLER_DOWNLOAD_BANNER_IMAGE      | No       | true    | Whether to cache the banner image used in the cards locally or fetch it each time directly from the website. Caching it consumes more storage space, but is more resilient against link rot and rate limits from websites.                                                                                                                                                    |
| CRAWLER_STORE_SCREENSHOT           | No       | true    | Whether to store a screenshot from the crawled website or not. Screenshots act as a fallback for when we fail to extract an image from a website. You can also view the stored screenshots for any link.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CRAWLER_FULL_PAGE_SCREENSHOT       | No       | false   | Whether to store a screenshot of the full page or not. Disabled by default, as it can lead to much higher disk usage. If disabled, the screenshot will only include the visible part of the page                                                                                                                                                                              |
| CRAWLER_SCREENSHOT_TIMEOUT_SEC     | No       | 5       | How long to wait for the screenshot finish before timing out. If you are capturing full-page screenshots of long webpages, consider increasing this value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| CRAWLER_FULL_PAGE_ARCHIVE          | No       | false   | Whether to store a full local copy of the page or not. Disabled by default, as it can lead to much higher disk usage. If disabled, only the readable text of the page is archived.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| CRAWLER_JOB_TIMEOUT_SEC            | No       | 60      | How long to wait for the crawler job to finish before timing out.
