## Optaining an API Key

To use the CLI, you'll need to get an API key from your karakeep settings. You can validate that it's working by running:

```
karakeep --api-key <key> --server-addr <addr> whoami
```

For example:

```
karakeep --api-key mysupersecretkey --server-addr https://try.karakeep.app whoami
{
  id: 'j29gnbzxxd01q74j2lu88tnb',
  name: 'Test User',
  email: 'test@gmail.com'
}
```
