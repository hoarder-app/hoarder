# Gemini Code Assistant Workspace Context

This document provides context about the Karakeep project for the Gemini Code Assistant.

## Project Overview

Karakeep is a monorepo project managed with Turborepo. It appears to be a web application with a focus on collecting and organizing information, possibly a bookmarking or "read-it-later" service. The project is built with a modern tech stack, including:

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Hono (a lightweight web framework), tRPC
- **Database:** Drizzle ORM (likely with a relational database like PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- **Tooling:** Prettier, ESLint (via oxlint), Vitest, pnpm

## Project Structure

The project is organized into `apps` and `packages`:

### Applications (`apps/`)

- **`web`:** The main web application, built with Next.js.
- **`browser-extension`:** A browser extension, likely for saving content to karakeep.
- **`cli`:** A command-line interface for interacting with the service.
- **`landing`:** A landing page for the project.
- **`mobile`:** A mobile application (details unknown).
- **`mcp`:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to communicate with Karakeep.
- **`workers`:** Background workers for processing tasks.

### Packages (`packages/`)

- **`api`:** The main API, built with Hono and tRPC.
- **`db`:** Database schema and migrations, using Drizzle ORM.
- **`e2e_tests`:** End-to-end tests for the project.
- **`open-api`:** OpenAPI specifications for the API.
- **`sdk`:** A software development kit for interacting with the API.
- **`shared`:** Shared code and types between packages.
- **`shared-react`:** Shared React components and hooks.
- **`trpc`:** tRPC router and procedures. Most of the business logic is here.

### Docs
