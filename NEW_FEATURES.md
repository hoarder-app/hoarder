# Potential New Features for Karakeep

This document lists potential new features brainstormed for Karakeep, categorized by perceived potential value and complexity.

## High Potential Value / High Complexity

1.  **Team Libraries / Collaborative Bookmarking:**
    *   **Description:** Enable users to create shared collections of bookmarks that multiple team members or collaborators can contribute to and access. This would involve roles, permissions, and activity feeds for shared libraries.
    *   **Value:** Significantly expands Karakeep's utility for group projects, research teams, or families.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Database schema, tRPC API, Web UI/UX for collaboration.

2.  **AI-Powered Content Recommendation Feeds:**
    *   **Description:** Generate personalized feeds of new web content (articles, tools, discussions) based on a user's existing bookmarks, tags, and inferred interests.
    *   **Value:** Transforms Karakeep from a passive storage tool to a proactive discovery engine.
    *   **Affected Areas:** AI/ML model integration, worker processes for content discovery and analysis, Web UI for feed display.

## High Potential Value / Medium Complexity

3.  **Enhanced Offline Access & Content Download (Mobile Focus):**
    *   **Description:** (Noted as planned in README) Robustly allow users to download the full content (archived pages, PDFs, images) of selected bookmarks or entire lists for offline access, particularly on mobile devices.
    *   **Value:** Critical for users who need access to their saved information without internet connectivity.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Mobile app (storage, sync logic), API for content packaging, worker processes.

## Medium Potential Value / Medium Complexity

4.  **Browser History Import & Intelligent Suggestion:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to import their browsing history. Karakeep could then analyze this history to suggest frequently visited or important sites to bookmark, automatically tag them, or identify patterns.
    *   **Value:** Helps users quickly populate Karakeep with relevant existing data and discover items they might have forgotten to save.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Browser extension or companion desktop app, worker processes for analysis, Web UI.

5.  **AI-Driven "Related Content" Discovery:**
    *   **Description:** While viewing a bookmark, use AI to suggest other relevant bookmarks from the user's own collection or even new related content from the web.
    *   **Value:** Enhances content discovery and helps users find connections within their saved knowledge.
    *   **Affected Areas:** AI model integration, tRPC API, Web UI.

6.  **Integration with External Note-Taking Apps:**
    *   **Description:** Provide integrations to send bookmarks, highlights, or AI summaries to popular note-taking platforms (e.g., Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, Evernote).
    *   **Value:** Improves workflow for users who use Karakeep as part of a broader personal knowledge management system.
    *   **Affected Areas:** API for integrations (possibly OAuth), worker processes for syncing, Web UI for settings.

7.  **Automated Broken Link Checker & Archival Suggestions:**
    *   **Description:** A background service that periodically checks saved bookmarks for broken links (404s, etc.). It could notify users and suggest searching for an archived version (e.g., via Wayback Machine integration or re-triggering Karakeep's own archival).
    *   **Value:** Helps maintain the integrity and usefulness of the bookmark collection over time.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Worker process, database for link status, Web UI for notifications.

## Low Potential Value / Medium Complexity

8.  **Public Profile/Portfolio Pages:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to curate and share specific collections of bookmarks publicly, creating a sort of digital portfolio or reading list to share with others.
    *   **Value:** Caters to users who want to share their discoveries or curated knowledge.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Public-facing web pages, user settings for public sharing, tRPC API.

## Low Potential Value / Low Complexity

9.  **Advanced Search Query Language Enhancements:**
    *   **Description:** Expand the existing search functionality with more operators (e.g., field-specific search like `content:term`, `url:domain`), saved searches, or more complex boolean logic.
    *   **Value:** Provides power users with more precise tools to find information within large collections.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Search parsing logic (`packages/shared/searchQueryParser.ts`), Web UI for search input.

10. **Gamification & Personalized Usage Insights:**
    *   **Description:** Introduce elements like bookmarking streaks, collection milestones, or personalized statistics and insights about a user's hoarding habits and content preferences.
    *   **Value:** Can increase user engagement and provide fun, reflective data.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Database for tracking metrics, tRPC API, Web UI for displaying stats.
