## Why did I build it?

I browse reddit, twitter and hackernews a lot from my phone. I frequently find interesting stuff (articles, tools, etc) that I'd like to bookmark and read later when I'm in front of a laptop. Typical read-it-later apps usecase. Initially, I was using [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) for that. Then I got into self-hosting and I wanted to self-host this usecase. I used [memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) for those quick notes and I loved it but it was lacking some features that I found important for that usecase such as link previews and automatic tagging (more on that in the next section).

I'm a systems engineer in my day job (and have been for the past 7 years). I didn't want to get too detached from the web development world. I decided to build this app as a way to keep my hand dirty with web development, and at the same time, build something that I care about and use every day.

## Alternatives

- [memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos): I love memos. I have it running on my home server and it's one of my most used self-hosted apps. It doesn't, however, archive or preview the links shared in it. It's just that I dump a lot of links there and I'd have loved if I'd be able to figure which link is that by just looking at my timeline. Also, given the variety of things I dump there, I'd have loved if it does some sort of automatic tagging for what I save there. This is exactly the usecase that I'm trying to tackle with Hoarder.
- [mymind](https://mymind.com/): Mymind is the closest alternative to this project and from where I drew a lot of inspirations. It's a commercial product though.
- [raindrop](https://raindrop.io): A polished open source bookmark manager that supports links, images and files. It's not self-hostable though.
- Bookmark managers (mostly focused on bookmarking links):
    - [Pocket](https://getpocket.com): Pocket is what hooked me into the whole idea of read-it-later apps. I used it [a lot](https://blog.mbassem.com/2019/01/27/favorite-articles-2018/). However, I recently got into home-labbing and became obsessed with the idea of running my services in my home server. Hoarder is meant to be a self-hosting first app.
    - [Linkwarden](https://linkwarden.app/): An open-source self-hostable bookmark manager that I ran for a bit in my homelab. It's focused mostly on links and supports collaborative collections.
    - [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/): Omnivore is pretty cool open source read-it-later app. Unfortunately, it's heavily dependent on google cloud infra which makes self-hosting it quite hard. They published a [blog post](https://docs.omnivore.app/self-hosting/self-hosting.html) on how to run a minimal omnivore but it was lacking a lot of stuff. Self-hosting doesn't really seem to be a high priority for them, and that's something I care about, so I decided to build an alternative.
    - [Wallabag](https://wallabag.it): Wallabag is a well-established open source read-it-later app written in php and I think it's the common recommendation on reddit for such apps. To be honest, I didn't give it a real shot, and the UI just felt a bit dated for my liking. Honestly, it's probably much more stable and feature complete than this app, but where's the fun in that?
    - [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori): Shiori is meant to be an open source pocket clone written in Go. It ticks all the marks but doesn't have my super sophisticated AI-based tagging. (JK, I only found about it after I decided to build my own app, so here we are ü§∑).
