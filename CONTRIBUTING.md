# Contributing to Karakeep

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project! This document outlines our contribution process and guidelines to make it easy for you to help improve this project.

## How Can I Contribute?


### Asking Questions

If you have questions:

* Use the GitHub Discussions Q&A section
* Search existing discussions to see if your question has been answered
* If not found, create a new discussion with a clear, descriptive title


### Reporting Bugs

If in doubt, about whether a problem you're seeing is a bug or not, use the discussions Q&A section instead. If it turns out to be a bug, we'll promote it into an issue. If you're sure it's a bug:
* Create a new issue using the bug report template
* Include a clear description and steps to reproduce
* Wait for triage and labeling by maintainers


### Suggesting Features

For feature requests:

* If you find a similar feature request, upvote it instead of creating a new one to help us prioritize it
* Create a new issue using the feature request template
* New features start with the `status/untriaged` label
  * If the feature request is approved, the maintainers will add the `status/approved` label and assign a priority to the issue
  * Other issues will get labeled with `status/icebox`. Issues in the icebox are not prioritized, until there's enough interest from the community


### Working on Issues

Before starting to work on an issue:

* Prefer working on `status/approved` issues to make sure they get prioritized for the review
* Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
* Read the [development documentation](https://docs.karakeep.app/Development/setup) to get started
* If you need help, you can find us in the #development channel in the [Karakeep Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NrgeYywsFh).
* Once you're done, open a PR and wait for review. Try to include a screenshot of the change in the PR description.

Please note that we're all volunteers. We'll aim to review your PR within a week from when they are opened.
